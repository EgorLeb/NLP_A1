rumamging in his cloak lokoing fro somehting but he did seem to realize he was beign watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still starign at him from the otehr end of teh street for some raeson the sight of teh cat seemed to amuse hmi he cuhckled and muttered i sholud have konwn he found whta he was looking fro in his inisde pocket it seemed to be a silevr cigarette lighter he flicked it oepn hedl it up in the air and cilcked it the nearest street lamp went otu with a littel pop he clicked it again teh nxet lamp flickered into dakrness twelve tiems he clicked the put outer until the only lihgts left on the whloe street wree tow tiyn pinrpicks in teh distance wihch were the eyes of the cat wathcing hmi if anyone looked out of their widnow now even beady eyed mrs dursley they woludn t be abel to see anything that wsa hpapening down on the paveemnt dumbledore slipped teh put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward numbre foru where he sat down on the wlal nxet to the cat he ddin t look at it btu after a moment he spkoe to it fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smlie at the tabyb but it had gone instead he was

about why he s disapperaed abuot what finalyl stopped him it seemed thta professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was mots anxious to discuss teh rela resaon she had been waiting on a cold hrad wall all day for netiher as a cta nor as a woman hda she fixed dumbleodre wtih such a piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone wsa saying she was not gonig to believe it untli

they weren t in a room as he had supposed thye were in a corridor teh forbidden croridor on teh tihrd floro adn now they knew wyh it was frobidden thye wree looking staright into the eeys of a

into bed the dog was guarding soemthing what had hgarid said gringotts was the safset place in the world fro something you wanted to hide ecxept perhasp hogwarts it looked as though harry had found out where teh grubby littie packgae from vualt seven hundred adn thirteen wsa chapter ten hallwoeen malfoy couldn t believe his eyse whne he saw that harry adn ron were still at hogwarts the netx day looking tired but perfectly cheerful indeed by teh next morinng harry and rno thouhgt thta meeting teh three headed dgo hda been an excellent advetnure and they weer quite keen to hvae antoher one in

etiher raelly valuable or raelly dangerous sadi ron or boht sadi haryr but as all tehy knew fro sure aobut the mysterious object was that it wsa about two inches logn tehy ddin t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues neitehr nevilel nro herimone showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dgo and the trapdoor all nevilel caerd about was never giong near teh dgo again hermione wsa nwo refusing to speka to haryr adn ron btu she was scuh a bosys know it all that tehy saw this as an adedd bouns all they relaly wnated now was a way of getting back at malfoy

reawrd for breaking rules came an angry vioce from just bheind them hermione was sotmping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the packaeg in harry s hadn i tohught yuo weren t speaking to us said harry yes don t stop now said ron it s diong us so much good hermione marched aawy with her nose in the air harry had a lto of trouble keeping his mind on hsi lessosn that dya it kept wandernig up to the dormitroy whree his new broomstick wsa lying unedr his bed or strayign off to the quidditch field where he d be learning to play that nigth he bolted his dinner that eevning witohut notiicng whta he was eating and tehn rushed uptsairs with ron to unwarp the nimubs tow thousand at lsat wwo ron sihged as the broomstick rolled onto harry s bedspread even hrary who knew nohting about teh different brooms thought it looked wonderflu sleek and shiny with a maohgany hadnle it had a long tail of neat striaght twisg and nmibus tow thuosand written in gold near the top as sveen o clock drew nearer harry letf the csatle adn ste off in the dsuk twoard the quidditch field hled never been insied teh stadium before hundreds of seats were raised in stnads around teh field so that teh spectators were hgih enoguh to see what was giong on at eithre end of the field were three goledn poles with hoops on the edn they reminded haryr of the little platsic sticks muggle cihldren belw bbubles through ecxept that they weer fifty fete high too eager to fly aagin to wati for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off frmo the ground what a feleing he swooped in adn out of teh goal posts adn tehn sped up and down teh fiedl the nimubs two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch hey potter come donw oliver wodo had arrived fei wsa carrying a large wooden crate under hsi amr harry landed next to hmi very niec said wood his eyse glitning i see what mcgongaall menat you realyl are a natural i m juts goign to teahc you the rules thsi evening then you ll be joining team practice three times a week he opened the crate inside were four difefrent sized balsl rgiht said wood nwo qiudditch is easy enoguh to understand even if it s not too esay to play there aer seven players on each side three of them are called chaesrs three chasers harry repeaetd as wood took otu a bright red ball abotu the size of a soccer ball thsi ball s callde the quaffle said wodo teh cahsers trhow teh quaffle to each other and try and gte it throguh oen of the hoops to score a goal ten points eveyr time teh qauffle goes throuhg oen of the hopos follow me the chasers throw teh quaffle and put it through teh hopos to score harry recietd so that s sort of like basektball on broomsticsk with six hoops isn t it what s basketball said wood curoiusly nevre mind siad harry quickyl nwo there s another player on ecah side woh s called the kepeer i m keepre for gryfifndor i hvae to fly around our hoosp adn sotp the other team from scoirng three chasers one keepre said harry woh wsa detremined to remember it all adn they play with the quaffle oaky gto that so whta aer thye for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box i ll show you now sadi wood take this he handde harry a smlal club a bit like a short baseball bat i m going to shwo yuo whta the buldgers do wood said these two are the bludgers he sohwed hrary tow identical balls jet black and slightly samller than the red qauffle harry notiecd that thye seemed to be srtaining to escpae the srtaps hodling them inside the bxo stand back wood warned harry he bent dwon and freed oen of the bludgesr at onec the black blal rose hgih in the ari and then pelted staright at harry s faec hrary swung at it with the bat to stop it form breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away itno the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who divde on tpo of it and managed to pin it to teh ground see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back itno the crate adn strappign it donw safely the bludgers rokcet around trying to knock playres off their brooms that s why you have two beatres on each team the weasley twins are ours it s their job to portect their side frmo teh bludgesr adn try and knock them twoard the other tema so tihnk you ve got all that there chasers tyr and score wiht the quaffle teh keeper gaurds the goal posts the beatres keep the bludgers away form their taem harry reelde off veyr good said wood er hvae teh bludgers ever killed anyone haryr asked hoipng he soudned offhadn neevr at hogwarts we ve had a couple of broken jwas but notihng wores than that now the last memebr of the team is the seeker that s you and you don t hvae to worry about the quaffle or teh bludgers unless they crack my head open don t worry the weasleys are mroe than a match fro teh bludgers i maen thye re lkie a pair of huamn bludgres thmeselves wood raeched into the crate and took otu the fourth adn lsat ball compared with the qufafle adn teh buldgers it was tniy about teh siez of a large walunt it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings this said wood is the golden snitch and it s the most important ball of teh lot it s very hard to cacth because it s so fsat adn difficult to see it s the seeker s jbo to ctach it yuo ve got to waeve in and otu of the chaesrs beatesr bludgesr and quaffle to get it befroe the other tema s seeekr bceause whichever seeekr catches the snitch wnis his taem an extra hundred and fifty points so tehy nearly always win that s why seekres get fouled so much a gmae of quidditch only ends when teh sintch is caugth so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months thye hda to keep bringing on substittues so the plyaers could get some sleep wlel taht s it ayn quetsions harry sohok his head he understood waht he had to do all rigth it was doing it that wsa giong to be the problem we wno t practice with the snitch yet siad wood carefully shutting it bcak inside teh crate it s too dakr we mgiht lose it let s try you out with a few of these he pulled a bag of ordinary golf blals out of his pocket adn a few minutes later he adn harry wree up in the ari wood throwing the gofl balls as hard as he could in every directoin fro harry to cathc harry ddin t miss a single one and wood was delighted after half an hour ngiht hda really fallen and they cuoldn t caryr on thta quiddithc cup ll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trugded back up to teh castle i woulnd t be surprised if yuo turn out bettre thna charlie weasely adn he could have played fro engalnd if he hdan t goen off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy whta with quidditch prcatice three evenings a week on top of all his hmoework btu harry colud hardly believe it whne he realized thta he d already been at hogwarts two months the castle felt mroe like hmoe than privte drive ever had his lessosn too were becmoing more and more interesting nwo taht thye hda masetred the basics on halolween mroning they woke to the delicious semll of baking pumpkin wafitng throuhg teh corridors even better professor flitwick announced in chamrs that he thuoght thye wree reday to satrt making objecst fly something they hda all been dying to try since they d seen him make neville s toad zoom aroudn teh classroom prfoessor flitwick put teh class itno pairs to practice harry s pratner wsa seamus finnigna

next then he d realized that nobody found this funny because thye were all so imrpessed at the way harry had manaegd to stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jeaolus and angry had gone back to taunting harry about haivng no proper famiyl it wsa true thta hrary wasn t giong bcak to privet drvie fro christmas professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of sutdents who

library they had indeed been searching books for falmel s name eevr since hagrid had let it slip becuase how else were they going to fnid otu what snape was trying to stela the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel migth have done to get himself inot a book he wasn t in great wizrads of the twentieth century or notable magiacl names of our tmie he wsa missing too form improtant modern magiacl discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry adn then of course there wsa the sheer size of the lbirary tens of thuosands of boosk thuosands of shelves hunderds of narorw rows hermione took out a lsit of subjetcs and titles she had deicded to searhc while rno strdoe off down a row of books and started pulling thme off the shelves at random harry wandered over to the restircted section he had been wondering fro a wihle if flamel wasn t somewhere in there unfortunately you needed a speically signed ntoe from one of teh tecahers to look in any of the resrticted books adn he knew he d never get oen thees weer the books cotnaining powerful dark magic never taguht at hogwatrs adn only read by older studenst studying advanced defense against

later ron adn hremione joined hmi shakign their haeds they went off to lunch yuo will keep looking while i m away won t yuo siad hermoine and send me an olw if you find anything and yuo could aks yoru parents if they knwo who flamel is siad ron it d be safe to ask them veyr sfae as they re boht dentists siad herimone onec the holdiays had started ron and harry were havnig too good a time to think

you off the field said herminoe as the match drew nearer howeevr harry beacme moer adn more nervuos whatever he told ron and herimone the rest of teh team wsan t too calm either the idea of overtkaing slytherin in teh hosue chmapionship was wonedrful no one had done it for seven years but would tehy be allowed to with suhc a biased referee harry didn t know whetehr he was imaginnig it or nto but he seemed to keep running into snpae wherever he wnet at tiems he evne wondeerd whether snpae was following him trying to cathc him on his own ptoions lessons were turning into a sort of weekyl torture snape was so horrible to harry could snpae posisbly know they d found otu aobut the sorcerer s stone hrary ddin t see how he colud yet he soemtimes had teh horribel feleing taht snape could reda minds

was thta thing yuo saved me form aynway firenze slwoed to a walk warned harry to keep his heda bowed in caes of low hangign barnches btu did not answer harry s qusetion thye made their way through the trese in slience for so long that harry thought firenez ddin t watn to talk to him anymore they wree passing through a particularly dnese patch of trees however when firenze suddenly sotpped harry pottre do yuo knwo what unicorn blood is used for no siad harry startled by teh odd question we ve olny usde the hron and tail hair in potions that is becasue it is a monstrous thing to slya a unicorn said firenze only one woh has nothing to loes and everything to gain would comimt scuh a crmie the blood of a uincorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrilbe price you have slian somethnig pure and deefnseless to save yourself adn you will haev btu a hlaf lief a cursed lfie from the mmoent the blood touches yuor lips haryr satred at teh back of firenze s head whcih was daplped silver in the monolight but who d be that desperate he wondered aloud if you re going to be cursed forever daeths better isn t it it is fiernze argeed unless all you nede is to stay alive long enuogh to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mena yuo can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer s stone of course teh elixir of lfie but i don t understand who can yuo think of nobody woh has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaitign their chance it was as though an iorn fist hda clenched suddenly around hrary s heatr over the rustling of teh trees he seeemd to hear once more what hargid had told hmi on teh night they had mte some say he died codwsallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in hmi to die do you mean harry croaked that was vol harry harry are yuo all rgiht hremione was rnuning towrad them down the path hagrid puffing alnog behidn her i m fine sadi harry hardly knowing waht he was saying the unciorn s dead hagrid it s in thta clearing back there this is where i leaev you firenze murmuerd as hargid hurired off to examine the unicorn you are safe nwo haryr sild off his back good luck harry potter said firenze the plantes haev been raed wrongyl befoer now even by centuars i hope this is one of those timse he turned and cnatered back into the depths of teh forest leaving harry sihvering behind him ron had fallen asleep in teh dark common romo waiting fro them to return he shouted something about qudiditch folus when harry roguhly shook him aawke in a matter of seconds though he was wdie eyed as harry began to tlel him adn hemrione waht hda happened in the forest harry couldn t sit dwon he pacde up and down in frotn of the frie he wsa still shaking sanpe wanst the stone for voldemort and voldmeort s waiitng in the foerst and all this time we thought snape just wantde to gte rich stpo saying the name siad ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wsan t lsitening fiernze saved me but he shouldn t haev dnoe so bane was furious he was talking about interfering wiht what the plnaets sya is giong to happen they must show that voldemort s coming back bnae thinsk frienze sholud have let vlodemort kill me i suppose taht s written in the stars as well will you stop saynig the name ron hissed so all i ve got to wait for now is snpae to steal the stnoe hrary went on feverishly then voldmeort wlil be albe to coem and fiinsh me off well i suppose bane

yuo anyway who says the centaurs are right it sounds like fortnue telilng to me and profesosr mcgonagall says that s a very imprecise branch of magci the sky hda turned ligth before thye stopped talking tehy went to bed exhausetd tehir thorats sroe but the night s surprises werne t oevr when haryr puleld back hsi sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded netaly underneath them tehre was a note pinnde to it just in caes chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in yeasr to come harry would never quite remember hwo he hda managde to get trhough his exams when he hafl expceted voldmeort to come bursting through the door at any moment yte the dasy crpet by and there could be no doubt that fluffy wsa stlil alive adn well behind the locked doro it wsa sweltering hot espceially in teh lagre

could trying to ignroe the stabbing pains in his forehead whcih had been btohering him ever sinec his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bda case of eaxm nervse becasue harry couldn t slepe btu the trtuh was that harry ketp being woken by hsi old nightamre execpt that it was now wosre than eevr because there wsa a hodoed fgiure dripping bolod in it maybe it was bceause thye hand t seen what harry had seen in the forest or because tehy didn t haev scars bunring on their foreheasd but rno adn hermione didn t seme as worired about the sotne as harry teh idae of voldemort certanily scraed them but he didn t keep visiting them in dremas and thye were so busy wiht their studying they didn t have much time to fret about what snape or anynoe else might be up to their very last exam
